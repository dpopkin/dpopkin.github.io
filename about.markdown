Hello!

I'm Daniel Popkin: a man with a Compsci degree, a few years of professional Larvel/Rails experience and an interest in Information Security. This about page has some general details about my experience, while the blog sections will be about whatever I want to write about.

### Personal Projects
- [DVLA](https://github.com/dpopkin/DVLA): An Intentionally broken Laravel/PHP application that I plan to use for the examples I write about in this blog.
- [This site](https://github.com/dpopkin/dpopkin.github.io): The code and posts for this blog/portfolio are OSS. Written in [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).
